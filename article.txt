Once upon a time, there was a female student who attends her school life in the St. Thomas Building.
All of her classmates didn't like her very much because she acts weirdly infront of them.
This affected the way she had relationships with others if ever she had one.
She had a crush on one of the boys in her class.
However, since she was known and seen as a weird girl, even her crush rejected her.
Because of the situation that she had, she got depressed and soon can't take it anymore, so she decided to kill her crush and herself after.
Some people say that this story is fake but,
some of the others also say that she haunts the place because she harnessed hatred and jealousy for the people that can develop a good relationship with others smoothly."
